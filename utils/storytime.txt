Tony Stark was tinkering in his workshop late into the night, the glow of his arc reactor illuminating a sea of blueprints and scattered 
tools. The Iron Man suit lay on a workbench, partially disassembled, as Stark adjusted a series of intricate circuits. A soft hum filled 
the room as his AI assistant, JARVIS, provided updates on his progress.

"Sir, the new repulsor upgrade is nearly complete. Should I prepare for a field test?" JARVIS inquired.

Tony glanced up from his work, a smirk playing on his lips. "You know me, JARVIS. I don’t do anything half-way. 
Let’s give it a test flight."

Minutes later, Tony donned the suit, his usual confident demeanor shifting to intense focus. The workshop’s doors opened, 
revealing the night sky above the city. With a smooth motion, he activated the suit’s thrusters and soared into the air.

He navigated through the city, performing loop-de-loops and sharp turns, the repulsors propelling him effortlessly. 
The upgrade worked flawlessly, but Tony’s attention was drawn to a distress signal flashing on his HUD.

He followed the signal to an abandoned warehouse. Inside, a group of thieves was attempting to steal sensitive technology. 
Without hesitation, Iron Man burst through the ceiling, landing in a cloud of debris.
